#### DONATE PLASMA: 
The fact that the coronavirus cases are at its peak which
subsequently leaves people with a high demand for plasma, we designed a form that
stores the necessary information which is required to donate plasma. This works in a
way that if a person is keen to donate his blood, he/she could enter their details which
gets updated on our site. Thereby making it easier for receiver to contact them directly using their details mentioned.
